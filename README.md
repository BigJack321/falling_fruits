# falling_fruits
My first game made with pygame, has a lot of flaws and could be done better using sprites.

You can move using A and D, you lose heart if apple falls on the ground or you catch a bomb. The speed of fruits and bombs increase with player score.
The game is pretty straight forward so you should be able to get a catch of what is going on without detailed rules.
